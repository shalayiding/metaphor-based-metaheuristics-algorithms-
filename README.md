The project is about metaheuristics-algorithms which optimize the cost function benchmark.
| Algorithm Name      | Function Name(s)  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Differential Evolution (DE) | `DE_solve` | Implements the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for optimization. This algorithm uses mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve a population of solutions. |
| Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) | `PSO_solve` | Implements the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each particle in the population moves through the search space based on its own experience and the best experience of its neighbors. |
| Krill Herd (KH) | `KH_solve` | Implements the Krill Herd (KH) algorithm. This bio-inspired algorithm simulates the behavior of krill individuals who move based on their neighbors, foraging, and diffusion. |
| Modified Krill Herd (MKH) | `MKH_solve` | Implements a modified version of the Krill Herd algorithm (MKH), which introduces additional steps like mutation around the global best and crossover. |


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

There are 3 main files that is important in the project:

- p1_function.py which contain all the cost function.

- p1_algorithm.py which contain PSO,DE,KH,BBKH.

- main.py which all the function call matplot generation.
