The project is about metaheuristics-algorithms which optimize the cost function benchmark.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

There are 3 main files that is important in the project:

- p1_function.py which contain all the cost function.

- p1_algorithm.py which contain PSO,DE,KH,BBKH.

- main.py which all the function call matplot generation.


### Prerequisites

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Python
